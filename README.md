# NMEA STM32 HAL LIBRARY test 
## Speedometer and accelerometer project
This is a more complex example of how to use [NMEA library](https://github.com/mpalka31/NMEA_STM32_HAL_LIBRARY). The project is documented using doxygen, so you should read documentation after cloning the project.

To build and use this project you will need:
- STM32 kit 

B-L475E-IOT01A2 used here but it can be easily converted for any other board.
- 1602 LCD with i2c converter
- GY-GPS6MV2 GPS module

It can be any other module which uses NMEA protocol and UATR to communicate.
- STM32CubeIDE

It is free and powerful IDE from ST but project can be easily moved to Keli or any other IDE
