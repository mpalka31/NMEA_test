This is a more complex example of how to use \href{https://github.com/mpalka31/NMEA_STM32_HAL_LIBRARY}{\texttt{ NMEA library}}. The project is documented using doxygen, so you should read documentation after cloning the project.

To build and use this project you will need\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item STM32 kit
\end{DoxyItemize}

B-\/\+L475\+E-\/\+IOT01\+A2 used here but it can be easily converted for any other board.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 1602 LCD with i2c converter
\item GY-\/\+GPS6\+MV2 GPS module
\end{DoxyItemize}

It can be any other module which uses NMEA protocol and UATR to communicate.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item STM32\+Cube\+IDE
\end{DoxyItemize}

It is free and powerful IDE from ST but project can be easily moved to Keli or any other IDE
